CT ↔︎ MC Model Training (Continued work from Ffmcbct)\n\nGoal: Mapping Simulated CT to Monte Carlo (MC) phantom.\n\nRegistration: Rigid/affine (for now) steps to line up the CT volume with the MC phantom grid; handling voxel spacing and orientation.\n\nHU → Materials: Convert HU to density/material classes (water, bone, soft tissue, etc.), then to the properties MC codes expect (indices, densities).\n\nModels: start simple with UNet for segmentation/material labeling. Explore CycleGAN for domain translation (e.g., CT kernel harmonization or CT↔︎density).\n\nLatent Space Recon: To reconstruct with missing data in FFM mode. (this is very interesting - analytically as well as from ML application viewpoint)\n\n\n\n\nRegistration: CT &lt;-&gt; MC model\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nKabelac A., et al. Latent space reconstruction for missing data problems in CT.\nTang C., et al. Unpaired LDCT Denoising Network Based on CycleGAN with Prior Image Information\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Fluence-Field-Modulated CBCT (FFM-CBCT)\n\n\nThe Fluence-Field-Modulated Cone-Beam CT (FFM-CBCT) project at UHN – Princess Margaret Cancer Centre explores how dynamically shaping X-ray fluence in space and time can reduce unnecessary dose while maintaining, or even improving, image quality in regions that matter most.\nOur early phase focused on building the entire workflow — from GPU-based simulation to benchtop validation — and characterizing the physics that drive it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGPUMCI simulation of FFM-CBCT on a head phantom with synthetic inserts\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\nGPUMCI Simulation: implemented FFM exposure control inside a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo engine, enabling high-fidelity projections for arbitrary collimator patterns.\n\nBenchtop demonstration: replicated those fluence patterns on the hardware system, proving controllable ROI-specific illumination in practice.\n\nFluence compensation: designed and tested correction routines to normalize projection intensity before reconstruction, mitigating the sharp transitions that modulation introduces.\n\nScatter modeling and correction: used simulation-based estimates and polynomial-surface fitting to recover the background field, accounting for both scattered and off-focal radiation.\n\nAnalysis and visualization: built lightweight tools for projection viewing, normalization checks, and fluence-versus-dose comparison.\n\nThese experiments established a fully functional FFM-CBCT pipeline capable of toggling between simulation and physical imaging — a platform for controlled dose-reduction and physics-driven image correction.\n\n\n\nBenchtop demonstration — comparison between FFM (left) and Standard (rigth) CBCT modes\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter Correction\nWhen the rectangular collimator limits the X-ray beam to a defined ROI, the “dark” detector region still records signal — largely from scatter and off-focal radiation.\nInstead of discarding this information, we used it to estimate scatter distributions and study the contribution of off-focal radiation as a secondary imaging channel.\nThis helped characterize how residual signal in non-illuminated regions encodes useful background information and how that can be leveraged for more accurate corrections.\n\n\n\n\n\nFFM signal. Primary in the ROI. Though the dark region, colliamtor shadow as we call it, or sometimes latent-space, is not devoid of useful signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nReconstruction experiments were performed using both our GPU-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the benchtop FFM-CBCT prototype, showing clear improvements in image quality (IQ) while lowering exposure.\n\nImage quality gains: In test-phantom studies, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved by 75–150 % and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) by 45–95 % within the region of interest (ROI).\n\nDose efficiency: MC simulations indicated that comparable image quality could be maintained in the ROI while reducing the total patient-equivalent dose by more than 50 %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBCT of a cabbage\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent separation: Simulations demonstrated separation of primary, scatter, and off-focal radiation (OFR) components, enabling targeted scatter estimation and correction.\n\nArtifact and noise suppression: Physical reconstructions showed artifact reduction, noise suppression, and contrast enhancement when compared to standard CBCT.\n\nROI-specific imaging: Selective fluence exposure allowed targeted imaging with minimal full-field burden, supporting the feasibility of task-based dose allocation.\n\nA representative summary from our benchtop results is shown below.\n\n\n\nROI\n% Δ SNR (FFM – CBCT)\n% Δ CNR (FFM – CBCT)\n\n\n\n\n1\n19.34\n25.09\n\n\n2\n8.14\n3.44\n\n\n3\n2.55\n11.44\n\n\n4\n17.41\nN/A\n\n\n\nOverall, the simplified setup and physical constraints of the FFM-CBCT design reduced dose while improving image contrast and noise performance.\nScatter and OFR signals from behind the shutter—normally discarded—were found to contain recoverable information that could be exploited by future DL techniques to further enhance IQ.\nAnd, because I just wanted to check there’s no worms inside the cabbage me and my landlord picked from his garden — I ran an FFMCBCT of it.
