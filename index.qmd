We've recently completed the the first phase of our development of **Fluence-Field-Modulated Cone-Beam CT (FFM-CBCT)** system —  
it began as a simulation framework and then evolved into a full benchtop implementation.
We built and validated:

1. **Implementation & simulation** on our GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo platform (GPUMCI);  
2. **Benchtop demonstration** of dynamic fluence control with a rectangular collimator;  
3. **Processing pipelines** to compensate for fluence-dependent intensity variation in reconstruction;  
4. **Scatter-reduction and correction methods** to recover uniform image quality at reduced dose.

Together, these established a baseline FFM-CBCT system capable of selective dose shaping and region-of-interest imaging.


I completed B.Math in Mathematical Physics with minors in Computer Science and Pure Math at the uWaterloo (2024).
Joined **UHN (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre)** and worked with [Dr. G. Bootsma](https://technauhn.ca/people/gregory-bootsma/) on FFMCBCT as a co-op and returned full-time after graduation.

## Right Now
We’re extending the FFM-CBCT platform by linking simulation + benchtop into a single framework  
capable of retrieving the material properties of scanned objects directly from measured data.  
This combined approach could allow quantitative imaging for proton therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery, 
where knowing a tissue’s true composition *and location* means tighter range prediction and more accurate dose delivery.

In high school I was active with [BDOAA](https://bdoaa.org) and represented Bangladesh at IOAA 2018. 
It was a lot of night skies, problem sets, and lifelong friends. Good ol' times.
