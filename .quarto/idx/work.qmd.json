Fluence-Field-Modulated CBCT (FFM-CBCT)\n\n::: {.pair}\n::: {.pair-text}\n\nThe **Fluence-Field-Modulated Cone-Beam CT (FFM-CBCT)** project at *UHN – Princess Margaret Cancer Centre* explores how dynamically shaping X-ray fluence in space and time can reduce unnecessary dose while maintaining, or even improving, image quality in regions that matter most.  \nOur early phase focused on building the entire workflow — from **GPU-based simulation** to **benchtop validation** — and characterizing the physics that drive it.\n\n:::\n::: {.pair-media}\n![GPUMCI simulation of FFM-CBCT on a head phantom with synthetic inserts](photos/FFMCBCT.png){width=80% fig-alt=\"Simulated FFM-CBCT head phantom\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n#### Methods:\n- **GPUMCI Simulation:** implemented FFM exposure control inside a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo engine, enabling high-fidelity projections for arbitrary collimator patterns.  \n- **Benchtop demonstration:** replicated those fluence patterns on the hardware system, proving controllable ROI-specific illumination in practice.  \n- **Fluence compensation:** designed and tested correction routines to normalize projection intensity before reconstruction, mitigating the sharp transitions that modulation introduces.  \n- **Scatter modeling and correction:** used simulation-based estimates and polynomial-surface fitting to recover the background field, accounting for both scattered and off-focal radiation.  \n- **Analysis and visualization:** built lightweight tools for projection viewing, normalization checks, and fluence-versus-dose comparison.\n\nThese experiments established a fully functional FFM-CBCT pipeline capable of toggling between simulation and physical imaging — a platform for controlled dose-reduction and physics-driven image correction.\n\n\n![Benchtop demonstration — comparison between FFM (left) and Standard (rigth) CBCT modes](photos/ffmcbct_on_benchtop.png)\n\n\n::: {.pair}\n::: {.pair-text}\n\n#### Scatter Correction  \nWhen the rectangular collimator limits the X-ray beam to a defined ROI, the “dark” detector region still records signal — largely from **scatter** and **off-focal radiation**.  \nInstead of discarding this information, we used it to estimate scatter distributions and study the contribution of off-focal radiation as a secondary imaging channel.  \nThis helped characterize how residual signal in non-illuminated regions encodes useful background information and how that can be leveraged for more accurate corrections.\n\n:::\n::: {.pair-media}\n![FFM signal.
