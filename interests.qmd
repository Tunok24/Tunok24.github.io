## Books

I owe my reading habit to **Douglas Adams**—both The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy _(the “trilogy in five parts”)_ and Dirk Gently. 

I’m slowly downloading audiobooks:

- [Douglas Adams] The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (trilogy of five) - read by the main man himself.
- [Terry Pratchett] Discworld Series (41 novels) - performed by Nigel Planer (personal favorite) and Stephen Briggs.
- [A. C. Doyle] Sherlock Holmes - performed by Stephen Fry
- [G. Orwell] 1984 -                          ''
- [P. G. Woodehouse] The Inimitable Jeeves -  ''
- [Robert Sheckley] Dimension of Miracles -   performed by John Hodgman
- [Kurt Vonnegut] Sirens of Titan - ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Artworks

I never trained formally, and I draw occassionally thanks to epiphanies. But mostly, because I got a couple childhood friends who inspire me a lot. Current quest: recreate scenes from sci-fi passages from the books I read and loved.

_(if you’d like to see them, you’ll have to ask nicely first ಠ‿↼ )_

**Inspirations:** grickle, cigstudio, the authors and a rotating cast of artists I stumble upon.


## Cooking
Here's some of my conjurations from the kitchen - stuff I'd actually make twice because they are not just hearty, but lungy and livery too.

One of them is tea of course. Tea is an amazingly useful thing, it gives me an excuse to talk to anyone.

## Games

Mostly retro—they’ve aged well imo: 
  
  1. AOE II, 
  2. AOM (gotta play the Retold), 
  3. Commandos, 
  4. C&C Tiberian Sun - recently finished on an M2 via Porting Kit, 
  5. Last Blade 2 - play multiplayer on FightCade2 with others around the world
